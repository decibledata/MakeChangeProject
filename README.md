# MakeChangeProject

## DESCRIPTION
In this project, I have been intsructed to work the cash register. Scanning items, receiving money, and giving back the proper amount of change. There are many challenges as i pursue through the syntax errors as well as typos in my own code. But with the result of my compilation(s) so far have been satisfactory. You will see that Ive decided to go with a more stylistic route, that which mimics the look and feel or a register. Well, as close as I could replicate given my first official week within Skill Distillery.

Throughout myhours of work I found myself obsessing with the look of the output given to the user. But with this being at the forefront of my mind, I managed to work the code into play whilst managing a clean look and feel for the user.

## TECHNOLOGIES USED
 	* Java
 	* Eclipse
 	* Sublime
 	* Git/GitHub
 	* Zsh/Unix
 	* MacOS Terminal

## CONCEPTS
While exploring many options, I find myself refering back to prework, as well as previous labs. Many of these concepts I've decided to use a variety of functions. Although many other variations would work, they wouldnt give me the results I seem to be looking for. As you are reading this Ive changed my logic about 4-5 time already. My main use is with method calling as well as a 'switch' to give the user a menu of items to interact with other than just new lines of code. 
Upon my testing, I've noticed i can get close to/similar results with different approaches. Butsome are better suited for a well devised attack.

Many variables are in use, including primarily the double data type do indicate the use of dollars and cents.
## LESSONS
	* COMMIT COMMIT COMMIT
	* Test your code, even if it seems incorrect. I've surprised myself off guard with a solution I wasn't actively looking for many times.
