# MakeChangeProject

## DESCRIPTION
In this project, I have been intsructed to work the cash register. Scanning items, receiving money, and giving back the proper amount of change. There are many challenges as i pursue through the syntax errors as well as typos in my own code. But with the result of my compilation(s) so far have been satisfactory. You will see that Ive decided to go with a more stylistic route, that which mimics the look and feel or a register. Well, as close as i could replicate given my first official week within Skill Distillery.

## TECHNOLOGIES USED
 	* Java
 	* Eclipse
 	* Sublime
 	* Git/GitHub
 	* Zsh/Unix
 	* MacOS Terminal

## CONCEPTS
While exploring many options, I find myself refering back to prework, as well as previous labs. Many of these concepts I've decided to use so far involve: while loops, if/else if statements, as well as method calling to give the user a menu of items to interact with other than just new lines of code. 
Upon my testing, Ive noticed i can get close to/similar results with different approaches. Butsome are better suited for a well devised attack.

Many variables are in use, including primarily the double data type.
## LESSONS
	* COMMIT COMMIT COMMIT
