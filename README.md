# MakeChangeProject

## DESCRIPTION
In this project, I have been intructed to work the cash register. Scanning items, receiving money, and giving back the proper amount of change. There are many challneges as i pursue through the syntaax errors as well as typos in my own code. But with the result of my compilation(s) so far have been satisfactory.

## TECHNOLOGIES USED
 	* Java
 	* Eclipse
 	* Sublime
 	* Git/GitHub
 	* Zsh/Unix
 	* MacOS Terminal

## CONCEPTS
While exploring many options, I find myself refering back to prework, as well as previous labs. Many of these concepts I've decided to use so far involve: while loops, if/else if statements, as well as method calling to give the user a menu of items to interact with other than  just new lines of code.

Many variables are in use, including primarily the double data type.
## LESSONS
	* COMMIT COMMIT COMMIT
